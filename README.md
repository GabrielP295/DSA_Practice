# Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

This repository tracks my progress through the **Blind 75** and **NeetCode 150** curated problem sets. My goal is to master fundamental algorithms and data structures while maintaining clean and efficient Java code.

## Goals
- Internalize common patterns
- Maintain optimal space/time complexity standards
- Consistent daily practice and iterative review through spaced repitition

## Language & Tools
- **Language:** Java 17+
- **Environment:** LeetCode / NeetCode
- **Syncing:** [LeetHub](https://github.com) (Auto-syncing submissions)

## Progress Tracker
- [ ] Blind 75: (15/75)
- [ ] NeetCode 150: (15/150)
